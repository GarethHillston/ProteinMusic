# Protein Music
Program to create music from DNA sequence, made as my Bachelor's thesis project.

I experimented with a couple methods; 

1) Determining the protein sequences a DNA sequence would generate and creating chord sequences stochastically based on that.
2) Using a neural network to train a Markov chain to determine the best probability space for changing between different notes, based on the input DNA sequence.

Some of the generated music can be heard at https://soundcloud.com/gareth-hillston/sets/biological-autogenerative

It's kind of janky lift music, but it's music!
